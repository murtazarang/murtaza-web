Murtaza Rangwala is a Ph.D. student at the Coordination at Scale Lab (CASLab)  at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg. His research interests include multi-agent coordination applied to robotics and autonomous systems, specifically through the use deep reinforcement learning. His focus is on safety critical applications with safety guarantees, and the evolution of novel coordination schemes between multiple agents.
